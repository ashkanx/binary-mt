                            <li>Throughout the duration of the Transaction and for as long as the Transaction is open, you are required to maintain a sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If your Account Equity is less than the Margin Requirement in

                            <li>The Margin Requirements can increase / decrease based on the aggregated size of your Open Position determined by the volume (number of lots), contract size (value per point in the original currency of the contract), market price and margin

                                analyses clients’ Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next order is deleted (orders without margin requirements
                                are not deleted); (iv) if your Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until your Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level.</li>
